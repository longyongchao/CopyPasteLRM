      "While most artists became established in other formats before moving to adult contemporary, Michael Bublé and Josh Groban started out as AC artists. Throughout this decade, artists such as Nick Lachey, James Blunt, John Mayer, Bruno Mars, Jason Mraz, Kelly Clarkson, Adele, Clay Aiken and Susan Boyle have become successful thanks to a ballad heavy sound. Much as some hot AC and modern rock artists have crossed over into each other, so too has soft AC crossed with country music in this decade. Country musicians such as Faith Hill, Shania Twain, LeAnn Rimes and Carrie Underwood have had success on both charts.\n",

      "Originally titled ``In Another Life '', the song was produced by Dr. Luke and Max Martin, both of whom co-wrote it with Perry. It is a midtempo pop song positioned on the piece of E major and has a tempo of 134 beats per minute. Joanna Holcombe from Yahoo! Music noted that the song is about first loves. Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly, said that the song is`` a midtempo ode to a summer - after - high - school love with whom she recalls sharing Mustang makeout sessions to Radiohead '''. Michael Wood from Spin magazine said that the song is one of the album's quieter cuts and that it recall (s) ``Perry's singer - songwriter days at L.A.'s Hotel Café ''. The song follows the chord progression of E -- G ♯ m -- C ♯ m -- A, and Perry's vocal range spans from B to E. Kitty Empire noticed that Perry's vocal is wistful throughout the song and that the references to June and Johnny Cash were unexpected. Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone stated that when Perry sings,' I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash, '`` it's understood that she's thinking of the scrubbed - up Hollywood version of June and Johnny, from Walk the Line.''

      "\n",
      "Adult contemporary music. A notable pattern that developed during the 2000s and 2010s has been for certain pop songs to have lengthy runs on AC charts, even after the songs have fallen off the Hot 100. Adrian Moreira, senior vice president for adult music for RCA Music Group, said, \"We've seen a fairly tidal shift in what AC will play\". Rather than emphasizing older songs, adult contemporary was playing many of the same songs as top 40 and adult top 40, but only after the hits had become established. An article on MTV's website by Corey Moss describes this trend: \"In other words, AC stations are where pop songs go to die a very long death. Or, to optimists, to get a second life.\"\n",
      "CJRL-FM. CJRL-FM is a Canadian radio station, broadcasting at 89.5 FM in Kenora, Ontario. The station broadcasts an adult contemporary format branded as 89.5 The Lake.\n",
      "WNAM. WNAM (1280 AM) is an adult standards formatted radio station licensed to Neenah-Menasha, Wisconsin, that serves the Appleton-Oshkosh area. The station is owned by Cumulus Media. It uses the \"America's Best Music\" format supplied by co-owned Westwood One, that combines soft oldies and soft adult contemporary music with a few standards songs each hour.\n",
      "Adult contemporary music. One big impetus for the development of the AC radio format was that, when rock and roll music first became popular in the mid-1950s, many more conservative radio stations wanted to continue to play current hit songs while shying away from rock. These middle of the road (or \"MOR\") stations also frequently included older, pre-rock-era adult standards and big band titles to further appeal to adult listeners who had grown up with those songs.\n",

      "KMJQ. KMJQ, (Majic 102.1), is an Urban Adult Contemporary-formatted radio station located in Houston, Texas. Owned by Radio One, it is one of the most well-programmed heritage urban contemporary stations in the U.S. and has a strong listenership repertoire among listeners in Houston. Co-owned with KBXX and KROI, its studios are located in the Greenway Plaza district, and its 100 kW transmitter is based outside Missouri City, Texas. It is one of the high-ranking stations in Greater Houston, commanding a Top 5 position according to Arbitron, with KMJQ sometimes reaching number-one on many reports.\n",
      "Adult contemporary music. AC radio stations may play mainstream music, but they will exclude hip hop, dance tracks, hard rock, and some forms of teen pop, as they are less popular amongst the target demographic of these radio stations, which is intended for an adult audience. AC radio often targets the 25–44 age group, the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s. A common practice in recent years is that many adult contemporary stations play less newer music because they also give ample airtime to hits of the past, so the de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart.\n",
